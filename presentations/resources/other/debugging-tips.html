        we expect.

        <p>
            Don't write 20 or 30 lines of code without testing what you have written.

            Batch your work into smaller units to understand what is going on.

        <h1>Example</h1>
        <p>
            I want to validate a form field when I click a button.
        </p>
        <pre class="fragment"><code class="js">
            $('btn').on('click', function(){
                console.log('click worked');
            });
            </code></pre>
        <p class="fragment">
            I test that my click is working before continuing with my work.
        </p>
        <pre class="fragment"><code class="js">
            $('btn').on('click', function(){
                console.log($('input').val());

        <h1>Read the documentation.</h1>
        <p>
            Using a third party library can be hard at times. Good libraries provide good documentation, examples and demos. Study them
            to understand how they should be used.

        Most error messages by your editor or browser point you to the exact line that is broken.

        If you can't tell what's going on, copy and paste that into Google.
