# Exercise 6
In this assignment we are going to work on descendant selectors and some of the newer CSS properties we have learned.
You'll do all of your work inside of the /styles/main.css file. 

Create a new repository for this and follow the same steps we did for assignment 1.  The starting source code can be found [here in this zip file](Exercise6.zip)
