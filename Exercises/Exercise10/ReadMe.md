## Part 6 - If Else Statement
The variable `part6Number` is going to be populated with a random number between 1 and 100.  Use an `if else` statement to perform the following tasks. 
- Create a variable called `part6Result`
- If `part6Number` is greater than 50, populate `part6Result` with 'Above 50'
- If `part6Number` fails the above test, populate `part6Result` with 'Below or equal to 50'
- Output `part6Number` to the element with the id of `part6Number`
- Output `part6Result` to the element with the id of `part6Result`

## Part 7 - If, Else If, and Else
The variable `part7Number` is going to be populated with a random number between 1 and 100.  Use an `if`, `else if` and `else` statement to perform the following tasks. 
- Create a variable called `part7Result`
- If `part7Number` is less than 25, populate `part7Result` with 'Below 25'
- If `part7Number` is greater or equal to 25 and less than 50, populate `part7Result` with 'Between 25 and 50'
- If `part7Number` is greater or equal to 50 and less than 75, populate `part7Result` with 'Between 50 and 75'
- If `part7Number` fails the above test, populate `part7Result` with 'Above 75'
- Output `part7Number` to the element with the id of `part7Number`
- Output `part7Result` to the element with the id of `part7Result`

## Bonus Challenge
In `js` attempt the following
- Create a variable that's value is an array of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Create a loop that loops from 0 to 10 and outputs it's index to the console.
- Retrieve the element with the class of 'bonus' and change its background color to blue.
