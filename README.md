# Course Description
This course will walk you through front-end web application development. The course will teach a number of technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks. It will also provide context on how front-end applications interact with APIs and other back-end technologies.

# Goal
Upon completion of this course, you will be able to create an interactive website and deploy it to a cloud-based hosting provider. You will be able to apply your front-end skills to a variety of off-the-shelf or SAAS (Software as a Service) solutions such as WordPress, Shopify, SquareSpace, etc. You will also understand the role that developers play on an overall product team to prepare you for a transition into a work environment.
